    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular language , nit was created by guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for:\n",
    "- web development (server side)\n",
    "- software development ,\n",
    "- Mathematics \n",
    "- system scripting \n",
    "\n",
    "## what can python do?\n",
    "- Python can be used on a server to create web appllicatiion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pyhton can be used alognside software to create workkflows.\n",
    "- Python can connect to the database , It can aslo read and modify files.\n",
    "- Pyhton can be used to hamndle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python can be used for rapid prototyping or , for production-ready software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    "- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose."
